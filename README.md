### ✅ **Task 2 — Customer Churn Prediction Pipeline 📊**  
**Objective:** Build a reusable and production-ready ML pipeline for predicting customer churn using the **Telco Churn Dataset**.  

**Process:**  
- Implemented **data preprocessing** (scaling, encoding) via `Scikit-learn Pipelines`.  
- Trained **Logistic Regression** & **Random Forest** models.  
- Performed **hyperparameter tuning** using `GridSearchCV`.  
- Exported the pipeline with **Joblib** for deployment.  

**Key Outcomes:**  
- Created a **modular ML pipeline** ready for real-world use.  
- Improved reproducibility and simplified **deployment workflow**.

### ✅ **Task 4 — Context-Aware RAG Chatbot 🤖**  
**Objective:** Develop a chatbot capable of retrieving knowledge from external sources and maintaining conversational context.  

**Process:**  
- Implemented chatbot with **LangChain** + **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  
- Embedded custom documents using **FAISS vector store**.  
- Integrated **context memory** for handling multi-turn conversations.  
- Deployed chatbot with **Streamlit** UI.  

**Key Outcomes:**  
- Built a **context-aware assistant** that can retrieve domain knowledge.  
- Demonstrated skills in **LLM integration**, **vector databases**, and **AI deployment**.

### ✅ **Task 5 — Auto-Tagging Support Tickets Using LLM 📩**  
**Objective:** Automatically tag support tickets into categories using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.  

**Process:**  
- Designed **zero-shot** and **few-shot** prompting approaches.  
- Used `google/flan-t5-large` from Hugging Face for inference.  
- Implemented **Top-3 tag prediction** per ticket.  
- Evaluated performance with **Top-k Accuracy**.  
- Added **fine-tuning placeholder** for production-ready improvement.  

**Key Outcomes:**  
- Showcased **prompt engineering** and **LLM-based classification**.  
- Demonstrated improvement of **few-shot learning** over zero-shot.  
- Highlighted **multi-class ranking techniques** in NLP.
